              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="middle-intro">
                I love to write YA fantasy and contemporary stories. My dream is to one 
                day be traditionally published. As for my computer science interests, I have a social media website that I would 
                love to create in the future once I have the technical skills necessary. I am currently studying website design
                 to make that dream a reality.</p>

                <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
                <p class="skill-p">During my year long senior project in 2021, I worked in a team of six to hard code the html/css for
                   a local nail salon website. I have studied html and css on my own as well 
                   as completed "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" Udemy course sections on html and css.

                <h3>Indie Author</h3>
                <p class="skill-p2">
                  Some people might not see this as a skill, but I can say from experience 
                  that it is. Publishing books on the internet doesn't just involve writing the novel. 
                  When I first started, I just published my books and did nothing else, and it felt like I was screaming 
                  into the void. To be even a modestly successful indie author, you have to be your own 
                  marketing team. You have to have the dedication to stick with it even when you're just 
                  seeing crickets in the beginning. Since 2020, I dedicated myself to gathering an audience for my books. 
                  I've studied and evolved to gain an audience and get my book out there. I would like 
                  to humbly say that my efforts have paid off.</p>
